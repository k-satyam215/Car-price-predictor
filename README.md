# Car Price Predictor 🚗💰

Car Price Predictor is a **machine learning web application** built using **Python, Streamlit, and Linear Regression** that predicts the **selling price of a used car** based on user-provided details.

The app uses a **pre-trained regression model** and a cleaned dataset to estimate realistic car prices, helping users understand the approximate market value of their vehicle.

## 🎯 Objective

The goal of this project is to:
- Predict used car prices using machine learning
- Demonstrate an **end-to-end ML deployment workflow**
- Build an interactive UI for non-technical users
- Apply regression techniques to a real-world dataset

---

## 🚀 Key Features

### 📊 Machine Learning–Based Prediction
- Uses a **trained Linear Regression model**
- Predicts car price based on historical data
- Fast and deterministic predictions

---

### 🧾 User Input Parameters
The prediction is based on:
- Car company
- Car model
- Year of purchase
- Fuel type
- Kilometers driven

---

### 🧠 Intelligent UI Logic
- Car models dynamically filtered by selected company
- Dropdowns populated from real dataset values
- Input validation and error handling

---

### 🖥️ Streamlit Web Interface
- Clean and simple UI
- Real-time prediction on button click
- Displays price in Indian Rupees (₹)

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. User selects car details from the UI
2. Inputs are converted into a structured DataFrame
3. Pre-trained Linear Regression model processes the data
4. The model predicts the car’s selling price
5. The predicted price is displayed to the user
